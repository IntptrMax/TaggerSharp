# tagger

This is a WD14-tagger in C# with a fast speed.

I have tested on i7-11700K and RTX3070 with coco2017, and get tags for more than 15000 images in 2 minutes.

Preload images is in experimenting, maybe it won't work well on some computer.

The model can be downloaded from https://huggingface.co/CannotFindObject/TaggerV3/tree/main.

Models are convereted from https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf and https://github.com/neggles/wdv3-timm .
